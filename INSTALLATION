First you must download all development files:

-Open the terminal
-Go to the directory where you want those files to be place,
 normally it is the home directory

-Execute the following command:
>>git clone git://repo.or.cz/Beursplein5.git

-The directory Beursplein5 is now created
>>cd Beursplein5

Update to the latest version of the files
>>git pull

Make the component
>>make

Look into the /build/ directory, the file 'com_beursplein.zip' has been created.
This is the components installation file for joomla.

Next step, install joomla, (for example in /var/www/joomla)
Go to the admin interface, click extensions -> install/uninstall
Upload the com_beursplein.zip
The component has now been installed

Now you must add the stocks, go to components -> Beursplein 5

The rest has to be created....
